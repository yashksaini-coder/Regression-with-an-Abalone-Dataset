# Abalone Age Prediction - Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4, Episode 4) 🐚🔮

## Introduction 🌊

This competition invites you to explore the fascinating world of abalones and test your machine learning prowess. By predicting the age of abalones accurately, you'll unlock insights into these marine mollusks and their growth patterns.

## **Objective** 🎯

Your mission is to develop robust machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the age of abalones based on their physical attributes.

## **Evaluation** 📊

Your submissions will be evaluated using the **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)** metric. This metric ensures your predictions are as close as possible to the true values while penalizing large errors.
